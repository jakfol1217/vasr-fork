TODO:
testdev should be {**test_split, **dev_split}, combine and add to repository all JSONS
should remove merge_clip_VL_feats_for_AB_filter.py
D_filter_vision_and_language + I_extract_clip_features_for_distractors = The CLIP feature extraction takes a lot of time because there are many image pairs.
We executed it in multi-process for different subsets and merged the features later with this code.
If you want to extract the CLIP features as well, we suggest to follow this advice.
